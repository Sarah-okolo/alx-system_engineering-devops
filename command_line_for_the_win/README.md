[CMD CHALLENGE](https://cmdchallenge.com/) is a pretty cool game challenging you on Bash skills. Everything is done via the command line and the questions are becoming increasingly complicated. It’s a good training to improve your command line skills!

As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green, and an animal badge is awarded to you.

I was successfully able to complete 29 levels of the challenge.
